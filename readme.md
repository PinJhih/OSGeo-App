## What I did

The following are what I did in the tasks and the app:

- Made a splash screen.
- To display OSGeo projects by RecyclerView.
- Designed login page.
- To show websites by WebView.
- Designed setting page with Dark Mode and Language Switch.

## What I learned

Because of the tasks, I tried to make many feature which I didn't make before, like:

- Splash Screen
- Login Page
- Setting Page
- Dark Mode
- Language Switch

And I am poor in designing. After I completed those tasks, I have gained a lot of designing experience.

Besides, it is not only a good chance for me to lrearning Kotlin and Git but also a good chance to practice English.

## Difficulties I faced

As a Taiwanese people, the biggest difficulty is to complet every thing in English. I spent much time to read the tasks.

And it also took me so much time to designing UI.
