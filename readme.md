# OSGeo App: My work!

## What I did

The following are what I did in the tasks and the app:

- Designed an app icon .
- Made a splash screen .
- To display OSGeo projects by RecyclerView .
- Designed login page .
- To show websites by WebView .
- Designed setting page with Dark Mode and Language Switch .

## What I learned

Because of the tasks, I tried to make many feature which I didn't make before, like:

- Splash Screen
- Login Page
- Setting Page
- Dark Mode
- Language Switch

Besides, I am poor in designing. After I completed those tasks, I have gained a lot of designing experience.
